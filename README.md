# Obsidian_menu
Simple Python program to manage Obsidian vaults.

# NOTE: This has only been tested on Debian-based distributions!

Obsidian is a popular and very versatile app. I decided I wanted to learn Python and learn more about the inner workings of Obsidian. Out of those drives came this project.

The Obsidian_menu only has 2 real uses right now: 
  1. Add a new vault
  2. Open an existing vault
 
 As I learn more features of Obsidian and dig a little deeper into how it works, I will update this repository. 
 Is this program practical? No. Not by any means. More of just a way to test the functionality of Obsidian, test my learning and understanding, and see what is really possible.
